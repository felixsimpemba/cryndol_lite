# Business Profile Creation Debugging Guide

## Issue Description
The business profile creation screen was not working properly - nothing happened when clicking "Complete Setup".

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added loading dialogs to show progress
- Added success/error messages with SnackBars
- Added comprehensive error logging

### 2. Debug Logging
Added detailed logging to track:
- API request details (URL, headers, body)
- API response status and body
- Token availability and validity
- Local storage operations

### 3. Mock Mode Support
Added a mock mode for testing when API server is not running:
```dart
// In lib/core/config/api_config.dart
static const bool useMockMode = false; // Set to true for testing
```

## Testing Steps

### Option 1: With API Server Running
1. Make sure your Laravel API server is running on `localhost:8000`
2. Complete personal profile signup
3. On business profile screen, enter a business name
4. Click "Complete Setup"
5. Check console logs for API request/response details

### Option 2: With Mock Mode (No API Server)
1. Set `useMockMode = true` in `api_config.dart`
2. Complete personal profile signup
3. On business profile screen, enter a business name
4. Click "Complete Setup"
5. Should work with mock delay and show success message

### Option 3: Skip Business Profile
1. On business profile screen, leave "I have a business profile" unchecked
2. Click "Get Started" (button text changes based on checkbox)
3. Should skip business profile creation and go to main app

## Debug Information

### Console Logs to Look For:
```
Creating business profile with name: [Business Name]
Using access token: [First 20 chars of token]...
POST Request to: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/business-profile
Headers: {Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Authorization: Bearer [token]}
Body: {"businessName":"[Business Name]"}
Response Status: [HTTP Status Code]
Response Body: [API Response]
```

### Common Issues:
1. **No authentication token**: Personal signup didn't complete properly
2. **Connection refused**: API server not running
3. **401 Unauthorized**: Token expired or invalid
4. **404 Not Found**: API endpoint doesn't exist

## Troubleshooting

### If API Server is Not Running:
1. Start your Laravel server: `php artisan serve`
2. Or enable mock mode: `useMockMode = true`

### If Token Issues:
1. Check if personal signup completed successfully
2. Check token storage in SharedPreferences
3. Verify token format and expiration

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check Flutter console for detailed error messages
2. Verify API endpoint exists: `POST /auth/business-profile`
3. Test API with Postman/curl to verify it works
4. Check Laravel server logs for any errors

## Success Indicators:
- Loading dialog appears when clicking "Complete Setup"
- Success message shows: "Business profile created successfully!"
- Navigation to main app occurs
- Business name is saved locally

## Error Indicators:
- Error message shows in red SnackBar
- Console shows detailed error information
- Navigation doesn't occur
- Loading dialog disappears without success
